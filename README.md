# Analysis of NYC Citi Bike Data: Will Investors Make Bikesharing in Des Moines a Reality? 
## Overview of the Analysis ##
### Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to provide an interested group of investors in Des Moines with data visualizations they have requested. The analysis must answer investor questions about bikesharing in NYC and provide insights about a potential investment in bikesharing for the city of Des Moines. Investors want to understand several key points about their potential investment and I will use Tableau to tell the story of the data. The source of data for the analysis will come from NYC Citi Bike data provided for public use located on the Citi Bike Website. To complete an appropriate analysis I must change one of the data columns from a number value to an expression of time. That is, I will use a text editor, Jupyter Notebook, and Pandas for creating Python code to convert a number (integer datatype) into a useable expression of hours, mintes and seconds (datetime datatype). The purpose of changing the datatype reveals the duration of every bike ride and consistently expresses a useable datatype throughout the data. I'll be using the month of August for this analysis because of the large volume of rides. 

Using the converted datatype, Iâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to answer the following investor questions:

What is the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
How many bike trips, for all riders and genders, are started every hour, every day of the week?
How many bike trips are started for each type of user and gender for each day of the week?
